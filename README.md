THIS APP WAS CREATED FOR THE SUBMISSION OF PROJECT no.3 FOR FTBC#11. Reuben and Daniel wanted to created an easy to use ecommerce app. How easy? So easy that even people with shit for brains can use it.
Ben Dan Ecommerce was designed for stupid people to use so if you don't know how to use it, congratulations, you're not stupid.
Don't @me or @daniel for any UX or UI issues. We're not interested in your comments. Don't like the aesthetic? Go shop on Lazada. Don't like the UX? Go shop on Amazon. We couldn't give a shit. This is a minimalist app for your minimalist consumerist needs.

Instructions on how to run app:
-go to the website
-sign in
-if you're not already signed up then confess your ecommerce sins to whatever God you believe in, get on your knees, beg for said god's mercy, repent and sign up.

AS A BUYER:
-click view more on the listing you're interested in
-input the qty you would like to buy for that item
-add to cart the items you want so you can live your late stage capitalist dystopian dreams of endless consumerism and mindless materialism
-check out in the "YOUR CART" page.
-watch as you slowly but surely sink into an oblivion of financial ruin.
-YOU'RE STUPID FOR SPENDING $ ON USELESS SHIT BUT WE HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY ANYWAYS.

AS A SELLER:
-hit "CREATE A NEW LISTING"
-fill in the form and don't skip form input fields you idiot.
-upload the picture from your computer. don't you dare upload porn you sick perv. we will find you and we will kill you. yeah, just like Liam Neeson in Taken.
-Hit submit new listing
-Observe your listing pop up on the listings page.
-Watch hopeless addicts of vapid consumerism exchange their hard earned $ for your stupid excuse of a product.
-Relish your capital gains and wipe the tears of your existential crisis off your face using the cash of the vacant souls you unremorsefully leeched from.
-HOPE YOU GET RICH BITCH. HOPE IT WAS ALL WORTH IT IN THE END.

HOW TO GET PAYMENT:
-Due to insufficient time that would've been needed to implemet stripe API before deadline, or some payment system, there is not yet any current way of collecting payment from users.
-This is a feature that might be implemented in the future.
-For now, you won't actually be using our app to ACTUALLY pay for stuff. Yeah, WE saved you from financial ruin. You should be thanking US, you ungrateful sod.
